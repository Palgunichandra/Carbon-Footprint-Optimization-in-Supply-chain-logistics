# Carbon-Footprint-Optimization-in-Supply-chain-logistics
Sure! Here's a detailed *explanation* of each step in your *Carbon Footprint Optimization in Supply Chain Logistics* project using a *deep learning model* in *Jupyter Notebook*:

---

## ðŸŒ± *Project Goal*

The aim is to build a deep learning model that can *predict carbon emissions* for delivery routes using various factors such as:

* Route data (distance)
* Fuel usage
* Weather conditions
* Traffic levels
* Cargo weight

You then use these predictions to *suggest the most environmentally friendly route* â€” not just the fastest or cheapest one.

---

## ðŸ§­ Step-by-Step Explanation

### *1. Data Collection*

We create or load data that includes:

* Distance of the delivery route
* Fuel consumed
* Weather and traffic conditions
* Cargo weight
* Target variable: Actual carbon emissions in kg

In real-world projects, this data would come from:

* Fleet management systems
* GPS/map APIs (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap)
* Weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
* Fuel sensors and logistics software

For demo purposes, we *simulate* this data using NumPy.

---

### *2. Data Preprocessing*

Before training a machine learning model, the data needs cleaning and formatting:

* *Label Encoding*: Convert categorical features (like weather: "clear", "rain", etc.) to numeric labels.
* *Feature Scaling: Use **StandardScaler* to normalize data (mean = 0, std = 1). Deep learning models train better with scaled data.
* *Train/Test Split*: Split the data into training and test sets (80/20 split). The model trains on the training set and is evaluated on the test set.

---

### *3. Model Training*

We use a *deep neural network* built with *TensorFlow/Keras*.

* *Input layer*: Takes 7 input features.
* *Hidden layers*: Two dense (fully connected) layers with 64 and 32 neurons using ReLU activation.
* *Output layer*: One neuron that predicts a single continuous value â€” carbon emissions (kg).
* *Loss Function*: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* *Optimizer*: Adam (adaptive learning rate)

The model is trained over *50 epochs* on the training data.

---

### *4. Evaluation Metrics*

Once trained, we predict carbon emissions on the test data and evaluate using:

* *MAE (Mean Absolute Error)*: Average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
* *RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)*: Square root of the average of squared errors â€” penalizes large errors more.
* *% Error*: How far off our prediction is, in percentage terms, from the actual average emission.

These metrics help us understand *how accurate our model is*.

---

### *5. Route Suggestion Engine*

This is the core *application* of your model.

You input real-time or simulated conditions for *multiple possible routes*:

* Distance
* Estimated fuel use
* Current weather & traffic
* Cargo weight

Then:

* The input is *encoded and scaled* using the same encoders and scalers from training.
* The trained model *predicts emissions* for each route.
* The system *recommends the route* with the *lowest predicted carbon footprint*.

This engine could later be integrated into a logistics app or dashboard.

## ðŸ§  Why Deep Learning?

Deep learning models can:

* Capture *complex, nonlinear relationships* between multiple input variables.
* Adapt better to high-dimensional data (e.g., weather + traffic + route data combined).
* Learn from *large-scale datasets* if you have millions of route records.
